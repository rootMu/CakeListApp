# CakeListApp
basic mvvm application calling a list of cakes

The application displays cakes in a grid format, each element is seperated using a card layout. 
It is possible to favourite items those favourited items are stored in a room database and persist between loads.
Clicking on each cake will display a toast with the description.


TODO:
Could have created a dialogue popup for each cake or used constraint sets to expand the card layout for animation effect
though time didn't allow for this so it is something left to do.
